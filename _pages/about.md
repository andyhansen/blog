Hi.
I'm a Wellington based Tech Lead and Ruby developer.

I use this blog to understand whatever is spinning around in my mind.
Most of what I've written has never been posted because I don't feel like it would be perfect for every single person who would read it.
Very silly, I know.

If you would like to get in contact, you can email me at blog@ my domain.
I've avoided listing it directly to reduce the chance of me being spammed.

My opinions are my own and not the views of my employer etc etc.
You know the drill.
