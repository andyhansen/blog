**Pick the right things to optimise.**
Working in software is creative work, and not a production line.
If your focus is on the speed of output, there are going to be a lot of things falling over behind the scenes which will only become apparent later on.
Examples are employee disatisfaction, burnout, and higher turnover.

**Deadlines and estimation.**
Giving people deadlines generally does not make someone more productive.
The person creating the deadline also made a massive difference.
A software developer is often too optimistic to estimate their own work, and a manager estimating their work makes them perform much worse.
An arcitect was able to create a more realistic deadline which increased productivity, but they found that a developer worked best without any hard deadline.
A deadline is going to lead to more bugs, because there is less time available to make sure you are producing a high quality product.

You might worry that without a deadline, there would be nothing to motivate the developer, but this is not the case when the work itself is rewarding.
A developer isn't going to fluff about and waste time when the work itself is rewarding.
When the work is rewarding, and their are no firm deadlines, developers are more productive, and a lot happier.
There is a time and a place for deadline, but they should be used sparingly whenever possible.

**Office space.**
The authors would run a programming competition every year at a variaty of workplaces, and were then able to compare workplace conditions with the results.
They found that, different teams within the same organisation performed roughly as well as each other.
And that teams had higher quality work, with lower error rates were in an office that had a noise level they were comfortable with.

People are going to be collaborating for a certain amount of each day.
Collaboration is great, but it's disruptive for people trying to get their work done in that same area.
As an office grows, you will reach a point that there is constant disruption going on in the background.
You solve this by breaking down the workplace in the team specfic offices, which allows team collaboration to happen without interrupting the rest of the office.

In general, the office space segment of the book boiled down to a few points.
Let people work in smaller spaces, with people they are actively working with, and let them structure that space themselves.
A sterile office is a sign of a happy office manager, but an unhappy development team.
Team offices may seem expensive, but they are much cheaper than the hidden cost that comes with a less productive development team.
