Pick the right things to optimise.
The early chapter spends a lot of time pointing out that some managers confuse performace tweaks which would help a production line, but are no help at all for creative tasks like software development.
If you are spending too much time focusing on the speed of output, there are going to be a lot of things falling over behind the scenes which will only become apparent later on.
Some examples are burnout, and people leaving the company.

Next up is deadlines and estimation.
There was some studies which compared the value of estimation and deadlines, and how it relates to productivity.
A developer estimating their own work was average, developer + manager was slightly worse, and just a manager doing the estimation was much worse.
However, they found that a developer was much more productive without a deadline.
Of course you would think that without a deadline then the developers are free to fluff about as much as they want.
The solution is that you need to make sure that the work is structured so that it feels rewarding.
By making the work rewarding, the developers are productive, and are a lot happier because there are not the same presures on them.

There is also the case that a forced deadline is going to lead to more bugs, because there is less time available to make sure you are producing a high quality product.
