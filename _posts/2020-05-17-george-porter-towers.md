When I first moved to Wellington, I lived down the road from this bizare building, [George Porter Towers](http://betonbrut.net/george-porter-towers/).
It was strange in so many ways: the barred windows, the glasshouse laundromats, and of course, the giant tower.
I was transfixed.
Why does this weird building exist?
Built when [brutalism](https://www.designingbuildings.co.uk/wiki/Brutalism) was popular, it is designed to look rough, unfinished, and unusual.
A great setting for a dystopian story, but no longer feels like a good fit for social housing.

Designed by the internationally aclaimed architect, [Sir Ian Athfield](https://www.thearts.co.nz/artists/sir-ian-athfield)

After sustaining earthquake damage, it's been empty for about a year, and [the Wellington councel has made the choice to demolish it](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12260331).
If it was just for decoration, I'd love to see it restored, it's a facinating building.
Designed by [Sir Ian Athfield](https://www.thearts.co.nz/artists/sir-ian-athfield), who is one of New Zealands only internationally recognised architects.
However, I don't think I'd ever want to live there myself, so it's not fair to think that money should be invested to make others live there.

Over the last year I've taken way too many photos of the tower. I hope you enjoy them!
