Wellington is a great place for interesting buildings, but in my opinion [George Porter Towers](http://betonbrut.net/george-porter-towers/) take the cake.
Designed by [Sir Ian Athfield](https://www.thearts.co.nz/artists/sir-ian-athfield), and named after [David George Porter](https://prabook.com/web/david_george.porter/191208), it was built in the 1970's for social housing.
