Overtime I've found one of the most important skills a software developer can have, is the ability to break work down into small pieces.
Unfortunately, getting work down to the right size is _just_ difficult enough that it becomes one of the first things we forget when under pressure.
You are pushing problem discovery into the task, rather than ironing out issues upfront.
This can work out _sometimes_, but you will often find that those unknowns will end up making tasks a lot larger than you planned.
On top of the unknowns, there are a range of other issues I've personally experienced with large chunks of work:

- It becomes much harder to focus after a few days of the same thing
- More code is written, which is harder to test and review
- A higher chance of finding extra features which end up being added in
- More likely to forget aspects of the acceptance criteria

Now that I've covered some of the downsides of having your work too large, I'm going to go through some of the upsides of smaller work.

## Delivering value early and less wasted work

When you breakdown your work you are focusing on delivering value in the smallest amount of work possible.
Once you've done the groundwork, you can begin filling out the "nice to haves" from there.
By working in this way you are able to test that a solution is working as expected, without overcommitting.
In a theoretical situation where you built all the features upfront, you will likely find that many of those were not as necessary as you originally thought.

## It keeps you fulfilled

This is a big one for me
