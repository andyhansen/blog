## Newtown All

I was lucky enough to be in a small group photographic exhibition as part of [Photocourse 3](http://www.photocoursenz.com/courses.html) with [Photospace Gallery](http://www.photospacegallery.com/).

The following is the blurb for my contribution to the exhibition.

> Living in Newtown makes it a natural subject for me.
> Every day is a new opportunity to see how this community has changed.
> During last years lockdown I found myself exploring the aspects of community which are not face-to-face.
> Examples turned up everywhere; donations to an op shop becoming an unlikely gallery, some shared mischief upon leaving the hospital, an artistic restoration to a neglected building.
> The members of these communities all add or subtract to the world around them, maybe never seeing who they share it with, but participating all the same.
>
> As I overcome my fear of portrait photography I'd like to take this work further.
> I'm inspired by the work of Julie Riley, who often paired her portraits with interviews about the people and their lives.
> Over time, I would love to develop my work towards the thoughtful and insightful books of hers such as Men Alone, and Our Town.

## A Sample

I thought it would be nice to write about some of the photos in the series. Since this is just for my blog I'll include a few of my favourite B-Sides. I'll let you decide which those are.
