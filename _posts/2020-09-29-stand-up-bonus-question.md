In my team, we take turns running stand up.
When you run the stand up you have to make sure it's staying on track, but you also get to come up with the bonus question of the day.
There aren't limits on what this question is, but it should of course be work appropriate.

If this sounds like something you would like to try out in your stand ups.. I've been keeping  a smaaaall list of questions which have been asked over the years. You are welcome to pick and choose any to try at your own stand up. I have not ordered of them in any way, because there are way too many.
