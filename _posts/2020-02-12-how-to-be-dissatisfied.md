I've made it my mission to never leave a workplace with a surprise complaint in my exit interview.
This has resulted in a few changes in my behaviour over the years, most of all being how I handle dissatisfaction when it arrises.
Rather than letting it stew, I do my best to understand the situation I'm in, the factors contributing to it, and how I might change the situation to make me happy again.
Once this has been mentally bundled, bring this to a manager or a leader and let them know.

Informing your mananger is not going to instantly solve your problem, but they will now be in a much better position to help you.
A good mananger will be doing the heavy lifting, seeking out your problems, helping to diagnose and solve them with you.
However, even the best managers won't be able to read your mind, so learning how to reveal, and articulate your dissatisfaction is important.
It can be tricky to navigate a manager who takes your dissatisfaction personally, but I've found that with the right approach, you can keep it productive.
Ironically, it's manangers like who can be a large source of dissatisfaction.

Approach is important if you want people to listen to you.
Complaining is a quick way of a finding out how widely spread an issue is, but it generally isn't going to get you towards a solution.
If you establish yourself as someone who _exclusively_ complains, people won't look to you for productive conversations
People are less likely to listen if you are
