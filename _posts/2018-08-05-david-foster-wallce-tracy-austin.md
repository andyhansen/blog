What I love about David Foster Wallace is how eloquently he takes you along on his emotional journey. This is incredibly clear in is essay, ["How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart"](https://www.scribd.com/doc/134106158/How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-David-Foster-Wallace), because his writing contrasts so well with Tracy Austin's poorly ghostwritten autobiography.

David Foster Wallace is incredibly disappointed in this book. 



I highly recommend giving it a read, or if audiobooks are more your thing, you can listen to David Foster Wallace himself reading it on YouTube below.
