It's an honour be exihibiting at Black Coffee, a cornerstone of Newtown through it's ebbs and flows.

>Newtown All is an attempt to observe the ways we shape the world around us, and how small anonymous actions can impact othersâ€™ experience within a space.
>
>Attaching a visitor pass to the crossing outside the hospital can encourage dozens to join in a shared rebellion. Posters are put up almost as often as they are torn down, their transitions marked by the hundreds of staples left in the powerpoles across Newtown.
>
>Changes like these come and go, surviving for a moment or building on top of each other to create something new. They serve as a constant reminder of the ability we have to empower the places we love, or mess with the places we hate. I hope that you can take these thoughts with you and create some small changes of your own.
