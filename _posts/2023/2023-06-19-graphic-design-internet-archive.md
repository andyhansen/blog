[Design Archive (archives.design)](https://archives.design/) is a collection of graphic design artefacts found on the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/).

Historic examples of graphic design are a real delight.
It warms my heart to see efforts going into curation as well as preservation.
These are resources I never would have known about if they weren't so well organised and presented.
It also made me excited enough that I wanted to put this together so that I'd always be able to find it again.
