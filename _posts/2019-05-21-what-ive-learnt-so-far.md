Over the last 4 years I've been working I've picked up a few knowledge nuggets along the way. I thought now would be a great chance to deep dive on some of those so that they aren't forgotten (by me).

**It's better to let people know that your project is not going to plan early, rather than overworking to get it over the line.** I've seen this done countless times, by myself and others. Pretending a project is getting along fine, and secretly dying inside because there is so much work to do. You are much better off just being upfront about where a project is at, and letting them know that you understand where you think it will end up, what might be missing, and how you plan to get the rest done on a more manageable timeline. Tricking yourself into thinking that it's all going to work out is just going to result in a low quality rushed project, which likely isn't finished.

**Know what you want to learn next.** At any one time, you should know what it is you want it is you want to learn next. You don't have to have a month long learning plan mapped out, but if someone was to give you time to study out of no where, then you should at least know what topics you'd like to start on. By constantly being mindful of what to learn next, you are constantly thinking forwards about where you may want to be growing.

**You aren't the first person who has had this problem.** Without knowing what the problem might be, you can almost guarantee that you aren't the only person who has struggled with it. Think about the problem a bit more, and how you would solve it, then jump on the internet to see how others have dealt with that same issue. A lot of wasted effort and angst has gone into re-inventing the wheel. This feeds into my other point about finding a mentor.

**Find a mentor (or two (or three)).** There is an awful lot of hard lessons to learn in the world of software. Having an experienced wall to bounce your problems off will allow you to solve them much faster than you otherwise could. If you work for a large company then you will probably be assigned a mentor or coach when you start, but even in a smaller company there should be plenty of people willing to help you out.

**Find enjoyment outside of software.** When you only have one skill, then a lot of your self esteem begins to get tied to how well you are currently doing at it. It can also make you pretty boring.

**Software doesn't have to be your life.** When I was first starting out, I had the impression that everyone was doing huge amounts of coding outside of their daily work. It was a depressing situation, because as much as I liked the occasional extracurricular programming that i was doing, I felt like it was never enough.
