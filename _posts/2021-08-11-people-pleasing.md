# Being a people pleaser

We want to be liked, and this doesn't stop when you become a leader.
People pleasing is great in moderation but, when it's your primary focus, you are delaying difficult conversations and disadvantaging your team.
Your time is better spent learning how to make good compromises.
Let's dig into some situations where people pleasing has got me in trouble.


## Agreeing to unrealistic deadlines or goals

It sucks to tell someone that something isn't possible not possible, but if you are making promises you can't deliver on then they will find out eventually.
It's a common way to end up burning out.
You make an optimistic promise, and then get stuck working extra hard to make sure it happens.
It's a good thing to push yourself to improve, but only it's not sustainable if it's constant.
You may also be setting up your team for failure by not giving them enough time to do well


## Letting your team stay in their comfort zone

This can be create in the short term for focused learning, but it will cause problems if it's constant.
It stops other team members from learning how to do that work, and it can mean that other team members are missing out on work that they enjoy.
Prioritisation also becomes more difficult if people are picking the most important task they can do, rather than the most important task.
You've been nice to one person, but the rest of the team now has to work around them.
With compromise, that person can get some of those tasks they really enjoy, but also give other team members an opportunity to learn them as well


## Avoiding difficult conversations

They are called "difficult" for a reason, but as a leader it's now your responsibility to be having a bunch of them.
At first I was avoiding them by either delaying, or being inauthentic at times when someone needed to hear the truth.
Life is easier in the short term, but eventually you've got to learn to [eat the frog](https://blog.

The easiest place to get some practice is to be authentic whenever someone is asking you directly for feedback.

Your team doesn't need to know about every bad thing which could _potentially_ happen, but if something is inevitable, then I find that it pays to let them know sooner rather than later.

** Also being inauthentic about how bad something is. You will lose trust if you can't deliver bad news

This also applies to giving people tough feedback. The sooner this feedback is delivered, the better it is for everyone involved.

** If you wait too long, the person is going to feel like a total ass.
