Everyone is going to have skills which come naturally, and skills which come after a lot of active consideration. Within this blog post I'm going to talk through some of the lessons I've learned

* Find resources which work for you. Podcasts, books (writing or audio), conference talks, forums, and many more. No one of these are going to be perfect for everyone, and preferences will also change overtime. Though you will often find these full of information you already know, they can be great ways of discovering different views on a topic that you are interested in.
  * Resources become increasingly important as you become a leader, because they are tools you can pass on to people as the situation arises.
* If you are giving feedback to people, you have to be comfortable with that loops being very long. It's not like code which can tell you within seconds that you've solved the problem, or made a mistake. Changes in behaviour take time, and you may find yourself repeating feedback multiple times before it really sticks for someone.
* People work in very different ways. It's easy to understand people who work in the exact same ways as you, but any diverse team is going to have a mix of personalities. Just because you don't immediately understand the way someone is motivated doesn't mean it's wrong.
* Just because someone has a set of values, it doesn't mean that they will live up to them. I'm constantly finding myself doing things which go against my values. This can happen for a variety of reasons: time pressure, personal life, and ??. Having "good" values is a great starting point, but it's often a long road to be living those values to the fullest.
* Being consistent it more valuable than being occasionally brilliant.
* Time management.
* Be clear about your expectations.
* If you've given someone more responsibility, you need to support them to ensure they can succeed. People can end up being put off when they've been given responsibility without the support to allow them to be successful. It can make them more hesitant to step up in the future.
* Create systems when you can. A system can be tweaked and adjusted overtime. It's much harder to do that when you are playing everything by ear.
* Saying "no" is important, but it's also easy to overdo.
* If you want to manage up, you need to be give specific examples. 
* If you're in a healthy team, people will appreciate constructive feedback just as much as positive feedback. If you are giving nothing but positive feedback, people are going to start getting suspicious that you are holding something back.
* Forming, Norming, Storming, and Performing will continue to be relevant throughout your career.
