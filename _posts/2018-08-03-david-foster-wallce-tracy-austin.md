We all all know how it feels to be on the receiving end of a terribly told story.
However, and somewhat ironically, it's not always easy to articulate exact _why_ it's a terrible story.
It wasn't until I read David Foster Wallace's essay, [How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart](https://www.scribd.com/doc/134106158/How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-David-Foster-Wallace) that I could really appreciate all of the the disappointing aspects to a shallow story.

If audiobooks are more your thing, you can listen to David Foster Wallace himself reading it on YouTube below.
