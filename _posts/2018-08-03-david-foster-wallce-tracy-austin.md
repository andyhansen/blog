We all all know how it feels to be on the receiving end of a poorly told story.
However, somewhat ironically, it can be difficult to perfectly articulate what makes a story so boring.
This is where David Foster Wallace comes in with his excellent essay, ["How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart"](https://www.scribd.com/doc/134106158/How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-David-Foster-Wallace), which is about the biography of his favourite childhood tennis player.
In the essay, we are given the full emotional rollercoaster he went on as he read the biography.
How the flat, lifeless language sucked away any chance he had to find out what it was really like to be Tracy Austin in those moments.

If audiobooks are more your thing, you can listen to David Foster Wallace himself reading it on YouTube below.

David Foster Wallace has an uncanny ability create an interesting narrative out of anything.
One example is his essay on [the grammar battle between dictionaries (pdf)](https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/HarpersMagazine-2001-04-0070913.pdf).
