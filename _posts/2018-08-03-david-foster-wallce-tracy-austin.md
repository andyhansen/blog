David Foster Wallace was incredibly disappointed by Tracy Austin's biography, and it feels like I've experienced his disappointment more than I've experienced my own at times.
DFW didn't just outline the areas this biography feel short.
He dived right in, giving a rich description of each layer as he went down.

Intense back and forth matches between Tracy and her rival were essentially reduced to "they got some points, I thought I was going to lose, I got some points, I won, that was good".
DFW reflects on what he was hoping to get out of the biography, a sense of what it was like to be Tracy in those intense, life defining moments.
Moments that mere mortals like us never truly know.
How the flat, lifeless language sucked away any chance he had to find out what it was really like to be Tracy Austin in those moments.



We all all know how it feels to be on the receiving end of a poorly told story.
However, somewhat ironically, it can be difficult to perfectly articulate what makes a story so boring.
This is where David Foster Wallace comes in with his excellent essay, ["How Tracy Austin Broke My Heart"](https://www.scribd.com/doc/134106158/How-Tracy-Austin-Broke-My-Heart-David-Foster-Wallace), which is about the biography of his favourite childhood tennis player.
In the essay, we are given the full emotional rollercoaster he went on as he read the biography.
How the flat, lifeless language sucked away any chance he had to find out what it was really like to be Tracy Austin in those moments.

If audiobooks are more your thing, you can listen to David Foster Wallace himself reading it on YouTube below.

David Foster Wallace has an uncanny ability create an interesting narrative out of anything.
One example is his essay on [the grammar battle between dictionaries (pdf)](https://harpers.org/wp-content/uploads/HarpersMagazine-2001-04-0070913.pdf).
