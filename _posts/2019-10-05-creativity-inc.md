I've just recently got through Creativity Inc, by __ __ and was totally blown away.
Though the advice being more directly applicable to the creative industry, there are many take aways which will change the way I work, and approach leadership.

At Pixar they have the concept of a brains trust - a group of experienced people who give feedback on a film during it's development process.
[There are many other blog posts explaining how they run it](https://www.fastcompany.com/3027135/inside-the-pixar-braintrust), so I will stick to talking about how I'll use that concept to adjust the way I'll try to work going forward.

There is a fantastic chapter dedicated to how a company must continue to release content to "feed the hungry beast", while still giving new "ugly baby" ideas room to grow.
Once you've achieved some success, a hungry beast will emerge which wants to continue consuming and creating.
However, if you to focus solely on the needs of the beast, you then neglect growing new ideas then you will end up stagnating.
Through this chapter I grew an understanding that it's not just growing new ideas that is important, you also need to keep the machine fueled.
There are parallels of this in other chapters, for example, they found that people were spending too much time perfecting every minor detail, which extending the time it took to develop new movies.

Another major topic was around how they managed to keep their values in place, even has Pixar continued to change.
There were multiple times they had to adjust their processes to make sure that the 

they had to constantly go out of their way to make sure their original ideals were still active. They highly valued candour, and wanted all employees to feel like they could speak their mind without fear of being punished because of it. However, despite being so keen to get open and honest feedback, they often found that 

They used short films as a way of growing and trialling new directors before committing them to larger films.

That acted with candour to make their employees feel more comfortable giving honest feedback. You have to show employees that they aren't going to be punished. If you do not operate honestly then you will just seem ignorant of the issues the company is having.

By being clear with people on how their work is going to be used, they know how much to commit to it. The example was people creating 70 different CDs which ended up being used in one small scene in Monsters Inc.

Balancing the beast and the baby **Chapter 7**

Walt Disney was able to create a successful company that struggled without him. Being a good leader is growing a company that isn't going to fall over once you are gone. You need to make sure you are being people on the journey with you. **Building and Sustaining Chapter** After Walt they didn't have a number 1 movie in 16 years

Hiring good people is the most important thing, everything else is secondary
