I recently got some advice on how my team could begin working more effectively, and it loved it so much I had to write this wee post about it.
The advice was simply this, "your team should be working outside of their comfort zone as much as they can".
It is so simple that I've got no idea why I hadn't thought of it before.

We were performing well as a team, but we were also only working on the areas of the codebase we knew.
I can see how we ended up that way: it's easier to estimate, the task will likely get done faster, and we assume that someone who knows that area of code is going to do a better job.
Upon reflection, the upsides are all very focused on the short-term, which is exactly why I got excited enough to write this post.
Below are some of the benefits I've come across since mixing up the work.

## Why it's great

There is no longer pressure on any one person to pick up "that type of story".

It enhances the collaboration between team members.

Speeds the team up long term, because you have all become a lot more diverse, the next story you pick up off the backlog isn't the one you know how to do, it's the highest priority story!

Stops people from being stuck on the same project for too long.

It gives you the perfect person to pair with.
You are able to get a lot more out of your code reviews and pairing sessions when the person you are with really understands the area of code you are changing.

## What may be stopping you from doing it

There are a few reasons I identified why we weren't already doing this.
The main one is probably pressure.
If your team is always under a lot of pressure, there isn't going to be time to start working on something you aren't good at.
"I don't want to ruin that persons plans for the codebase"
