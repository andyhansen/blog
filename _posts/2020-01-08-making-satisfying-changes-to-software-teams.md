Development teams are an ever changing entity, sometimes the changes are organic, but large changes should be well planned.
A team can lose faith in their leadership when large changes are poorly planned.
I thought it would be useful to go through what I consider to be the anatomy of an effective change, and some pitfalls which can lead to making bad decisions.

## Verify there is a problem to be solved

Before you start making a plan, you need to make sure that the change you are wanting to make is solving a real problem.
Change for the sake of change comes with few potential upsides, and when it's frequent, it can result in teams [spending a lot of time "storming", rather than "performing"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm).
Problems can also be tricky beasts, ask yourself if you have discovered a symptom, or a cause.
Either way, the best way to understand an issue is to talk to those with first hand experience, from there you can begin to unpeal the onion. I'm going to use "teams in your company refuse to work on each others codebases" as an example problem, and solve it as we move through this post.

## Understand success looks like

What does it look like once your identified problem has been completely solved?
Understanding what success looks like gives you focus when you begin solution discovery.
However, if your criteria is too restrictive, you will be inadvertently limiting yourself when trying to discover a solution.
Once you begin looking at solutions, you may find that your success criteria needs some adjustment.

## Solution discovery

With a loose grip on your problem and your solution, you can now pull people in to focus on potential solutions.
I'd recommened going into these discussions with a few ideas of your own, but not letting them dominate the discussion.
Techniques like design thinking can be used for larger decisions.
At the end of this process I often find there will be one larger proposed change, and a few small ones which might be worth trying.

## Communicate the change

## Feedback and interation

## An example

    By speaking with the tech leads, you discover that conflicting code styles result in code reviews full of nitpicks.
    As you can imagine, there will be layers below that causing teams to be siloed, but I'll keep it simple in this case.

    Continuing with the example, you can probably see a few possible success criteria we might pick.
    As a metric, "code styles are more unified", is too specific to the coding styles.
    We want developers to feel empowered to work on another teams codebase, so my pick would be "developers feel more comfortable working on other teams codebases".
    You could also make something more specific, such as "developers feel comfortable making _small_ changes to another teams codebase".

    You're now bringing those tech leads back, with
