Development teams are an ever changing entity, sometimes the changes are organic, but large changes should be well thought out, and planned.
A team which consistently seeings changes being made which are difficult to understand, or have unplanned negative impacts are going to lose faith quickly.
I thought it would be useful to go through the anatomy of an effective change, and pitfalls which can lead to making bad decisions.

Before you start making a plan, you need to make sure that the change you are wanting to make is solving a real problem.
Change for the sake of change comes with few potential upsides, and when it's frequent, it can result in teams [spending a lot of time "storming", rather than "performing"](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_86.htm).
Problems can also be tricky beasts, ask yourself if you have discovered a symptom, or a cause.
Either way, the best way to understand an issue is to talk to those with first hand experience, from there you can begin to unpeal the onion. I'm going to use "teams in your company refuse to work on each others codebases" as an example problem, and solve it as we move through this post.

    By speaking with the tech leads, you discover that conflicting code styles result in code reviews full of nitpicks.
    As you can imagine, there will be layers below that causing teams to be siloed, but I'll keep it simple in this case.

What does it look like once your identified problem has been completely solved?
Understanding what success looks like gives the change focus.
Be careful when defining success criteria, if your criteria is too restrictive, you will be inadvertently limiting yourself when trying to discover a solution.

   Continuing with the example, you can probably see a few possible success criteria we might pick.
   As a metric, "code styles are more unified", is too specific to the coding styles.
   We want developers to feel empowered to work on another teams codebase, so my pick would be "developers feel more comfortable working on other teams codebases".
   You could also make something more specific, such as "developers feel comfortable making _small_ changes to another teams codebase".

Now that you have a firm grip on what the problem is, and what success is, you need to start thinking about potential solutions.
This is a great opportunity for your to field test your proposed success criteria, and start consulting the team again.
