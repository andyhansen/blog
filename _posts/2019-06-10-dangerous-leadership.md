I had a strange realisation recently; I had become a more confident leader, but it didn't always mean that I was a better leader. If you haven't heard of the concept of being "good enough to be dangerous", I'll do my best to explain it here.

It's when get good enough at something that you become overconfident. Sometimes you have to run into a few walls before you realise that your original methods don't scale. As you read on, I'll be explaining some of the walls I ended up running into.



Being able to have an idea for an improvement, and running with it all the way to completion. Then you get too many going at once, and you aren't able to dedicate time to each one like you could the first, which makes them fail.

Able to facilitate meetings, but run into trouble when they start going off track.

Knowing to ask for input, but not always knowing the right ways of doing so, which means you either get too much, which is difficult to manage because not everyone will really end up being listened to, or too little which means you end up just making the decision yourself.

Your opinions and behaviour now carry more weight.

Better at building building your point of view, and building an argument, but you need to be careful that your new confidence is making it harder for others to participate.
