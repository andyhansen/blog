Being unable to express dissatisfaction is a common trait of many people working in software.
I mean, of course it is.
We get taught how to talk to a computer, then they put us in a team with a bunch of people.
It's unsurprising that a lot of the issues you will encounter in yor career are people, rather than computer problems.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about people problems, and I've compiled some of that thinking into this blog post you are reading with your eyes in this beautiful moment we can share together.

Let's start by thinking about why you might be annoyed. Generally it's one of a few things:

1. Someone has made a decision you don't agree with
1. Someone is acting in a way which you don't agree with
1. You have got yourself in a situation which you have to get yourself out of

Hopefully I'll be able to teach you a few things to address points 1 and 2, so that you can avoid getting yourself into point 3.

Alright, that's enough scene setting.
Let's say it's happened, you have found yourself in a situation where you are annoyed.
To keep things focused we are going to say it's a specific person doing a specific thing.
In these situations I generally find myself expressing annoyance in a combination of four ways.

*Process the situation in your own mind.*
This can be a healthy place to start.
I find myself asking questions like "is my annoyance justified?", "are they aware of the effect their behaviour is having?", or "am I just annoyed because I'm hungry?".
These are not applicable to every situation, but can be helpful starting points as I work out what I should be doing next.

*Confide your annoyance with someone safe.*
Whether it's a manager or a friend, everyone needs to have a safe person to talk through your annoyances with.
This is your chance confirm if your feelings are justified, and if they are, how you should proceed.
A good mananger will be able to give you the training on effective feedback, or give deliver feedback for you.
Most of what I've learnt about effective feedback has come out of conversations like this with people much more experienced than me.
It can be cathardic to spend your time complaining, but be wary that it's probably not going to improve your situation.
Try to focus on specific behaviours or decisions you don't agree with, so that you can constructively work out the best way to correct them.

*Exploding in a rage.*
Can happen from time to time if a person has done something particularly terrible, or if they've have a minor annoying behaviour for a very long time.
Exploding at someone can feel great in the moment, and _can_ make them very aware of what they are doing wrong, but does have a tendancy to make them defencive, and gives them and oportunity to make you look like the villian.
I've seen plenty of solid feedback get ignored because it was delivered in an unpalitable way.

*Giving them feedback.*
This is where you want to end up, and what I'll be spending the rest of this blog post talking about.

## The anatomy of effective feedback

There are a thousand resources to given good feedback, and yes, I am unironically adding one more.
ASK is the best feeback framework I've found for getting started.
Before giving feedback you make sure that is is *actionable*, *specific*, and *kind*.
I generally have to tweak my feedback until it has all three of those properties.

As a quick example, I'm going to make some feedback fit within the ASK framework.
"I really hate when you show up to stand up late" certainly tells someone that you are frustraighted when they are late, but the lack of kindness will make them less likely to take initative on the implied action of "showing up to stand up on time".
