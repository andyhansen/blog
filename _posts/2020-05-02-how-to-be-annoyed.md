Being unable to express dissatisfaction is a common trait of many people working in software.
I mean, of course it is.
We get taught how to talk to a computer, then they put us in a team with a bunch of people.
It's unsurprising that a lot of the issues you will encounter in yor career are people, rather than computer problems.

I've spent a lot of time thinking about people problems, and I've compiled some of that thinking into this blog post you are reading with your eyes in this beautiful moment we can share together.

Let's start by thinking about why you might be annoyed. Generally it's one of a few things:

1. Someone has made a decision you don't agree with
1. Someone is acting in a way which you don't agree with
1. You have got yourself in a situation which you have to get yourself out of

Hopefully I'll be able to teach you a few things to address points 1 and 2, so that you can avoid getting yourself into point 3.

Alright, that's enough scene setting.
Let's say it's happened, you have found yourself in a situation where you are annoyed.
To keep things focused we are going to say it's a specific person doing a specific thing.
In these situations I generally find myself expressing annoyance in a combination of four ways.

*Process the situation in your own mind.*
This can be a healthy place to start.
I find myself asking questions like "is my annoyance justified?", "are they aware of the effect their behaviour is having?", or "am I just annoyed because I'm hungry?".
These are not applicable to every situation, but can be helpful starting points as I work out what I should be doing next.

*Confide your annoyance with someone safe.*
Whether it's a manager or a friend, everyone needs to have a safe person to talk through your annoyances with.
This is your chance confirm if your feelings are justified, and if they are, how you should proceed.
A good mananger will be able to give you the training on effective feedback, or give deliver feedback for you.
Most of what I've learnt about effective feedback has come out of conversations like this with people much more experienced than me.
It can be cathardic to spend your time complaining, but be wary that it's probably not going to improve your situation.
Try to focus on specific behaviours or decisions you don't agree with, so that you can constructively work out the best way to correct them.

*Exploding in a rage.*
Can happen from time to time if a person has done something particularly terrible, or if they've have a minor annoying behaviour for a very long time.
Exploding at someone can feel great in the moment, and _can_ make them very aware of what they are doing wrong, but does have a tendancy to make them defencive, and gives them and oportunity to make you look like the villian.
I've seen plenty of solid feedback get ignored because it was delivered in an unpalitable way.

*Giving them feedback.*
This is where you want to end up, and what I'll be spending the rest of this blog post talking about.

## The anatomy of effective feedback

There are thousands of resources on giving good feedback, and I am unironically adding one more.
[A.S.K. is the best feedback framework I've found for getting started, because it's simple](https://medium.com/unsupervised-learning/giving-actionable-specific-and-kind-feedback-6fc83eb04a65).
Give feedback which is *actionable*, *specific*, and *kind*.

Creating feedback which is _not_ "ASK", is easy.
"I really hate when you show up to stand up late".
This certainly tells someone that you are frustraighted when they are late, but it is unkind, and they probably won't take initative on the implied action of "showing up to stand up on time".

In my opinion, better feedback looks something like "I appricate mornings can be busy, but I'd like to show up to stand up on time. It's important to me that everyone in this team respects each others time".
Within this feedback you are offering them an excuse, but you are telling them directly what you need from them, and why you think it's important.

Working out the best way to give a bit of feedback is useful for everyone.
It's clear to the person receiving the feedback what they have done wrong, and it gives them something specific that they can change.
I've also found it useful as the person giving the feedback.
It helps me to understand specifically what has annoyed me, and why it annoyed me.

Of course, giving feedback does not guarentee it will be acted upon, but it's in your best interest to make is as likely as possible.

## When to give feedback

Constructive feedback early and often is one of the best indicators of a healthy team.
It means issues are being dealt with before they become a real problem.
When I get feedback it's a massive relief, because it's an opportunty for me to become a better teammate.
It's also incredibly empowering to be a part of a team which is looking out for each other in this way.
You can feel safe knowing that you are a valued member of the team, because any issue you are causing is open for discussion.

Early feedback does not mean instant, I generally recommend it giving it privately afterward.
Public feedback is better kept for particularly bad behaviour which needs to be stopped right away.

Now that all sounds well and good, but how do you go about creating a culture of feedback?

## Creating a culture of feedback

Creating a culture of feedback is not a short process, but you will see the benefits at every step along the way.
Feedback needs to be supported by a culture which allows failure.
Getting feedback can mean you are failing in some (often minor) way.
A culture of feedback where it is not safe to fail is a hostile environment, and will not last long.
Your motivation when responding to feedback should be to become a better teammate, not to avoid punishment.

The best way to kick start a culture of feedback is to give everyone the tools they need.
Run small sessions (no more than 5ish) with each of your teams, giving them the fundamentals of feedback, and explaining why it's important.
Use this session as a discussion, giving participants the opportuntiy to talk about what they think makes good or bad feedback.
Over the next few weeks, the participants have a bit of homework: one positive, and one constructive piece of feedback for each member of their team.
This is best done face-to-face, but over messages can work as well if the team is very new to this.
In my experience, these sessions work as a great ice-breaker to the idea of feedback.

To maintain that momentum, you can run these feedback sessions a few times each year.

## Feedback can be positive

I've focused on the negative here, but these tools can be used to give positive feedback as well.
Positive feedback, can make a massive difference to a someones day.
